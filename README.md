# mapSHIFT: Neighborhood Map

This application was created for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. This particular project required the use of KnockoutJS to handle data binding for the location list and filtering. Additional functionality requirements included: filterable map markers to identify locations and the use of a third-party API (besides Google Maps) to display additional information for selected locations. As always, a responsive UI is required.
